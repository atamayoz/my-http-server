# My-http-server
This is a small java http server created with the `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` just for fun and learning.

In the project I included some patterns like builders and singletons with the aim of learning and remembering some concepts I usually donâ€™t practice in the day to day.

If  you have any comments or improvements, please post an issue to take a look at it.


## Requirements
This project requires Java 21 or latter.
